        <h3>Methods of processing</h3>
        <p>
          The Owner takes appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized
          access, disclosure, modification, or unauthorized destruction of the
          Data.<br />The Data processing is carried out using computers and/or
          IT enabled tools, following organizational procedures and modes
          strictly related to the purposes indicated. In addition to the Owner,
          in some cases, the Data may be accessible to certain types of persons
          in charge, involved with the operation of this Website
          (administration, sales, marketing, legal, system administration) or
          external parties (such as third-party technical service providers,
          mail carriers, hosting providers, IT companies, communications
          agencies) appointed, if necessary, as Data Processors by the Owner.
          The updated list of these parties may be requested from the Owner at
          any time.
        </p>
        <h3>Legal basis of processing</h3>
        <p>
          The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the
          following applies:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes.
            Note: Under some legislations the Owner may be allowed to process
            Personal Data until the User objects to such processing (“opt-out”),
            without having to rely on consent or any other of the following
            legal bases. This, however, does not apply, whenever the processing
            of Personal Data is subject to European data protection law;
          </li>
          <li>
            provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement
            with the User and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof;
          </li>
          <li>
            processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to
            which the Owner is subject;
          </li>
          <li>
            processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public
            interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the
            Owner;
          </li>
          <li>
            processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests
            pursued by the Owner or by a third party.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal
          basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the
          provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement,
          or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.
        </p>
        <h3>Place</h3>
        <p>
          The Data is processed at the Owner's operating offices and in any
          other places where the parties involved in the processing are
          located.<br /><br />
          Depending on the User's location, data transfers may involve
          transferring the User's Data to a country other than their own. To
          find out more about the place of processing of such transferred Data,
          Users can check the section containing details about the processing of
          Personal Data.
        </p>
        <p>
          If broader protection standards are applicable, Users are also
          entitled to learn about the legal basis of Data transfers to a country
          outside the European Union or to any international organization
          governed by public international law or set up by two or more
          countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by
          the Owner to safeguard their Data.<br /><br />
          If any such transfer takes place, Users can find out more by checking
          the relevant sections of this document or inquire with the Owner using
          the information provided in the contact section.
        </p>
        <h3>Retention time</h3>
        <p>
          Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by
          the purpose they have been collected for.
        </p>
        <p>Therefore:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of a
            contract between the Owner and the User shall be retained until such
            contract has been fully performed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Personal Data collected for the purposes of the Owner’s legitimate
            interests shall be retained as long as needed to fulfill such
            purposes. Users may find specific information regarding the
            legitimate interests pursued by the Owner within the relevant
            sections of this document or by contacting the Owner.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period
          whenever the User has given consent to such processing, as long as
          such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged
          to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to do so
          for the performance of a legal obligation or upon order of an
          authority.<br /><br />
          Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted.

        <h2 id="rights_subjects">The rights of Users</h2>
        <p>
          Users may exercise certain rights regarding their Data processed by
          the Owner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users entitled to broader protection standards may exercise any of the
          rights described below. In all other cases, Users may inquire with the
          Owner to find out which rights apply to them.
        </p>
        <p>In particular, Users have the right to do the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Withdraw their consent at any time.</b> Users have the right to
            withdraw consent where they have previously given their consent to
            the processing of their Personal Data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Object to processing of their Data.</b> Users have the right to
            object to the processing of their Data if the processing is carried
            out on a legal basis other than consent. Further details are
            provided in the dedicated section below.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Access their Data.</b> Users have the right to learn if Data is
            being processed by the Owner, obtain disclosure regarding certain
            aspects of the processing and obtain a copy of the Data undergoing
            processing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Verify and seek rectification.</b> Users have the right to verify
            the accuracy of their Data and ask for it to be updated or
            corrected.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Restrict the processing of their Data.</b> Users have the right,
            under certain circumstances, to restrict the processing of their
            Data. In this case, the Owner will not process their Data for any
            purpose other than storing it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Have their Personal Data deleted or otherwise removed.</b> Users
            have the right, under certain circumstances, to obtain the erasure
            of their Data from the Owner.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b
              >Receive their Data and have it transferred to another
              controller.</b
            >
            Users have the right to receive their Data in a structured, commonly
            used and machine readable format and, if technically feasible, to
            have it transmitted to another controller without any hindrance.
            This provision is applicable provided that the Data is processed by
            automated means and that the processing is based on the User's
            consent, on a contract which the User is part of or on
            pre-contractual obligations thereof.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Lodge a complaint.</b> Users have the right to bring a claim
            before their competent data protection authority.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Details about the right to object to processing</h3>
        <p>
          Where Personal Data is processed for a public interest, in the
          exercise of an official authority vested in the Owner or for the
          purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner, Users may
          object to such processing by providing a ground related to their
          particular situation to justify the objection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users must know that, however, should their Personal Data be processed
          for direct marketing purposes, they can object to that processing at
          any time without providing any justification. To learn, whether the
          Owner is processing Personal Data for direct marketing purposes, Users
          may refer to the relevant sections of this document.
        </p>
        <h3>How to exercise these rights</h3>
        <p>
          Any requests to exercise User rights can be directed to the Owner
          through the contact details provided in this document. These requests
          can be exercised free of charge and will be addressed by the Owner as
          early as possible and always within one month.

        <h2>Applicability of broader protection standards</h2>
        <p>
          While most provisions of this document concern all Users, some

          subject to broader protection standards.
        </p>
        <p>Such broader protection standards apply when the processing:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>is performed by an Owner based within the EU;</li>
          <li>
            concerns the Personal Data of Users who are in the EU and is related

          </li>
          <li>
            concerns the Personal Data of Users who are in the EU and allows the

          and internet information.
        </p>

          We will not collect additional categories of personal information
          without notifying you.
        </p>
        <h4>
          How we collect information: what are the sources of the personal
          information we collect?
        </h4>
        <p>
          We collect the above mentioned categories of personal information,
          either directly or indirectly, from you when you use this Website.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, you directly provide your personal information when you
          submit requests via any forms on this Website. You also provide
          personal information indirectly when you navigate this Website, as
          personal information about you is automatically observed and

          third parties that work with us in connection with the Service or with
          the functioning of this Website and features thereof.

        <h4>
          How we use the information we collect: sharing and disclosing of your
          personal information with third parties for a business purpose
        </h4>
        <p>
          We may disclose the personal information we collect about you to a
          third party for business purposes. In this case, we enter a written
          agreement with such third party that requires the recipient to both
          keep the personal information confidential and not use it for any
          purpose(s) other than those necessary for the performance of the
          agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may also disclose your personal information to third parties when
          you explicitly ask or authorize us to do so, in order to provide you
          with our Service.

        <h4>Sale of your personal information</h4>
        <p>
          For our purposes, the word “sale” means any “selling, renting,
          releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring
          or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic means,
          a consumer's personal information by the business to
          <strong
            >another business or a third party, for monetary or other valuable
            consideration</strong
          >”.
        </p>
        <p>
          This means that, for example, a sale can happen whenever an
          application runs ads, or makes statistical analyses on the traffic or
          views, or simply because it uses tools such as social network plugins
          and the like.
        </p>
        <h4>Your right to opt out of the sale of personal information</h4>
        <p>
          You have the right to opt out of the sale of your personal
          information. This means that whenever you request us to stop selling
          your data, we will abide by your request.<br />Such requests can be
          made freely, at any time, without submitting any verifiable request,
          simply by following the instructions below.
        </p>
        <h4>Instructions to opt out of the sale of personal information</h4>

          What are the purposes for which we use your personal information?
        </h4>
        <p>
          We may use your personal information to allow the operational
          functioning of this Website and features thereof (“business
          purposes”). In such cases, your personal information will be processed
          in a fashion necessary and proportionate to the business purpose for
          which it was collected, and strictly within the limits of compatible
          operational purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may also use your personal information for other reasons such as
          for commercial purposes (as indicated within the section “Detailed
          information on the processing of Personal Data” within this document),
          as well as for complying with the law and defending our rights before
          the competent authorities where our rights and interests are
          threatened or we suffer an actual damage.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will not use your personal information for different, unrelated, or
          incompatible purposes without notifying you.

          The disclosure described above will be limited to the personal

          If we deliver our response electronically, the information enclosed
          will be "portable", i.e. delivered in an easily usable format to

        </p>
        <h4>The right to request the deletion of your personal information</h4>
        <p>
          You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal
          information, subject to exceptions set forth by the law (such as,
          including but not limited to, where the information is used to
          identify and repair errors on this Website, to detect security
          incidents and protect against fraudulent or illegal activities, to
          exercise certain rights etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
          If no legal exception applies, as a result of exercising your right,
          we will delete your personal information and direct any of our service
          providers to do so.
        </p>
        <h4>How to exercise your rights</h4>
        <p>
          To exercise the rights described above, you need to submit your
          verifiable request to us by contacting us via the details provided in
          this document.
        </p>
        <p>
          For us to respond to your request, it’s necessary that we know who you
          are. Therefore, you can only exercise the above rights by making a
          verifiable request which must:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify
            you are the person about whom we collected personal information or
            an authorized representative;
          </li>
          <li>
            describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to
            properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We will not respond to any request if we are unable to verify your
          identity and therefore confirm the personal information in our
          possession actually relates to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you cannot personally submit a verifiable request, you can
          authorize a person registered with the California Secretary of State
          to act on your behalf.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are an adult, you can make a verifiable request on behalf of a
          minor under your parental authority.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can submit a maximum number of 2 requests over a period of 12
          months.
        </p>
        <h4>How and when we are expected to handle your request</h4>
        <p>
          We will confirm receipt of your verifiable request within 10 days and
          provide information about how we will process your request.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will respond to your request within 45 days of its receipt. Should
          we need more time, we will explain to you the reasons why, and how
          much more time we need. In this regard, please note that we may take
          up to 90 days to fulfill your request.
        </p>
        <p>Our disclosure(s) will cover the preceding 12 month period.</p>
        <p>
          Should we deny your request, we will explain you the reasons behind
          our denial.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable
          request unless such request is manifestly unfounded or excessive. In
          such cases, we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act on the
          request. In either case, we will communicate our choices and explain
          the reasons behind it.
